			The sweet mango jam filling is made with fresh mangos that were cooked 
			down. There is a hint of fresh lemon juice that was added to bring out the 
			mango flavor. This delightful treat is refreshing and light. It is a great option 
			for those who cannot have dairy. It's best to be eaten on the day of delivery, but
			will be just as great stored in the fridge the next few days.  </p>

			usually found in Asian stores. Despite the name, there is atually not pineapple in
			it. It is named that way because of the markings on top. This bread has a crunchy, 
			sweet top and a pillowy, soft inside. It is baked fresh on the day of delivery. It 
			is best eaten the day of delivery, but can be stored overnight in an air-tight container. 
			Microwave the next day and enjoy the warm and soft bread that tasts like it just 
			came out of the oven. </p>
