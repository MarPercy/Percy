	<p> We are a family run business here in Rockwall. We have dedicated a lot of time and effort into finding the most natural and 
    unprocessed ingredients for our desserts. We use organic unbleached sugar and flour as well as cage-free eggs. Macaron House is also eco-friendly as 
   we use reusable piping bags and baking sheets. Even the dish soap used to wash the preparation bowls, are enviromentally safe and free from bad stuff.
   The containers used to ship our product to your home is made from biodegradable paper that can be recycled of reused. Our mission is to offer affordable 
   desserts that are as natural and organic as possible. We hope to provide you with small treats and love from our family to yours.
